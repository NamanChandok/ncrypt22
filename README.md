## Celestial

Celestial is a metaverse inspired by the concept of Club Penguin and the aesthetics of Gravity Falls. <br>
We named our metaverse Celestial because we wanted to provide our users with a heavenly experience, an island where they can interact with people from all around the world, customise their avatars, play minigames, build their own treehouses and adopt pets.
